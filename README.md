# Welcome to Controlled Chaos

Hi.  
I’m TurboRigby — a developer, system enthusiast, and someone who enjoys understanding *why things are the way they are*.

I’m interested in systems, runtimes, browsers, and infrastructure more than buzzwords.  
I’ve written questionable amounts of low-level and experimental code so I don’t have to believe in magic.

> It’ll be a bang as long as it’s written in Golang.

## 🧠 What I Actually Care About

- Operating systems & low-level architecture  
- Runtimes, schedulers, memory models  
- Browsers (yes, including engines and specs)
- Backend systems that stay boring under load
- Debugging things most people prefer not to touch

I strongly prefer **understanding over abstraction** and **predictability over cleverness**.

## ⚙️ Languages & Tools I Use Intentionally

### Backend / Systems
![Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=go&logoColor=white)
![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)
![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
![Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=linux&logoColor=white)
[![Fiber](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fiber-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=fiber&logoColor=white)](https://gofiber.io/)
[![GORM](https://img.shields.io/badge/GORM-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=gorm&logoColor=white)](https://gorm.io/)
[![Typescript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
[![Fastify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Fastify-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastify&logoColor=white)](https://www.fastify.io/)
[![Drizzle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Drizzle-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=drizzle&logoColor=white)](https://drizzle.orm.org/)
[![tRPC](https://img.shields.io/badge/tRPC-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=trpc&logoColor=white)](https://trpc.io/)

### Frontend (when it must exist)
![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
[![Next.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next.js-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white)](https://nextjs.org/)
[![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=white)](https://react.dev/)
[![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white)](https://tailwindcss.com/)
[![Shadcn](https://img.shields.io/badge/shadcn-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=shadcn/ui&logoColor=white)](https://shadcn.com/)
[![Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vercel-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel&logoColor=white)](https://vercel.com/)
[![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white)](https://angular.dev/)

Frontend is a runtime too — just one with worse constraints.

## 🧩 Things I’ve Done (and Survived)

<!--- - Contributed to **Ladybird Browser** — because browsers shouldn’t be black boxes     Commented until the pull request will get accepted --->
- Built backend systems where “simple and observable” was the main feature  
- Wrote experimental stuff (kernels, languages, runtimes) to remove illusions, not to ship products  
- Learned the hard way why large systems look the way they do

Most of my serious work lives outside flashy demos.

## 🧪 Philosophy

- If a system can’t be reasoned about — it’s broken  
- If debugging requires faith — it’s already lost  
- Complexity must earn its place  
- “Rewrite it properly” is usually a trap  
- Boring systems scale better than smart ones

## 🧨 Final Note

I don’t chase hype, trends, or “10x” narratives.  
I prefer tools that fail loudly, systems that explain themselves, and code that doesn’t lie.

If something explodes — fine.  
At least we’ll know **why**.

And preferably, it’ll be written in Go.
